## Updates

Expect regular updates! I monitor all used packages, run tests and deploy updates in my free time. The delay in updates shouldn't be more than a week.

Mod updates are exclusively handled by the modpack itself - click update on modpack only to sync all mods. Updating individual mods independently may lead to further instability.

## Support

All suggestions and feedback are welcome, particularly from mod developers (I'm open for a cooperation). Join my Discord at https://discord.gg/hTuqEUmeg3 to share your thoughts and ideas!
